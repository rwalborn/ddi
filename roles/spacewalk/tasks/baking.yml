## this routine is for use when baking AMI's
## if you need to install spacewalk packages from special channels as part of the ami build you can include them here
## then we will remove registration as the last step to reset for the autoscaling group
## you will need to re-add any special channels that were added into your cloud-init lc if you want updates to be delivered
## the channel also can be added via the spacewalk gui
