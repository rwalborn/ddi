# Runs as ansible-playbook -vvvv -i 'localhost,' foo.yml

# useful commands
# aws iam list-server-certificates
# aws iam delete-server-certificate --server-certificate-name

# iam_cert only starts to work after ansible 2.1.2
# and it is still too stupid to read the key from vault,
# run the playbook with decrypted file, then encrypt before committing the file

# AWS API does not allow cert replacement with same name
# So we will name the cert with expiration date
# Expiration date format is yyyymmdd
